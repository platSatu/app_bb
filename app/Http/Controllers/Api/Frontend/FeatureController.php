 * (shared X-API-KEY secret) — see routes/api.php's `frontend.api-key`
 * group. Same trust model and shape as the other /api/frontend/*
 * endpoints alongside it.
 *
 * Only `status = active` rows are exposed. `images_url` is appended —
 * WebFeature::getImagesUrlAttribute() isn't included in toJson() by
